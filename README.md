# biplot_ggplot
Code to create a biplot manually using ggplot, applied to wine data.

The biplot displays the chemical characteristics of wines with arrows, plots the observations, colours them 
according to quality, and I added an extra arrow showing the direction of quality (by regressing the quality variable 
on the first two Principal Components). 
Legend added manually using grid graphics
